      <p>
        The purpose of the home page is to provide a strong landing zone for those who want to review my resume. It will include a simple design and flow in order to sufficiently direct any future employers or interested parties to the necessary portions of my resume. It will feature 2 images. One being a picture of me. Two, a picture of me and my girlfriend. It will also feature a simple logo-esque “CW.” This main page will also have simple details about me. How old I am, hobbies, and other bonus fun facts about myself. Therefore, the main reason people will come to this site is to learn more about me. I will also include a simple few sentence  description of my technical skills. I’m currently majoring in cloud computing. On this main landing page, I will have a simple portion dedicated to that. Additionally, in this main page, I will include an opening few sentences describing my objective. My overall purpose for submitting my application and stating my desire of employment.

      <h3>Job Experience</h3>
      <p>
        This page will primarily consist of my main work experiences. It will contain a list which will have the dates and locations of places I’ve worked at in the past. It will also have a section for references. That section will contain the phone numbers and/or emails of my prior bosses and managers. That way, if a future employer wants to ask about me or get more information, or even verify what I’ve said in the résumé, they will be able to get the info needed to reach out through this location of the website. The thing I want to capitalize on in this portion of the résumé website is transparency. I want this part to be particularly clean and easy to understand. That way, the information portrayed will encourage future employers to look more into me and find honesty in my thoroughness. This webpage will have many stock images. These images will be used to add an eye-catching aspect of the site. For example, one of the places I worked at was a pizza place. For that part of the site it will have a picture of pizza!

      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p>
        This final page will be a little bit more casual and personal. I want to talk about skills that I have and share experiences which have brought me learning. Although I don’t have any now, this part of the site would contain a navigation menu of projects that I have completed. This page is intended to be the one where I particularly sell myself. I want to talk about who I am and the skills that I have. In this part of the page, I will share why I think I will be valuable employee. And I will also include specific expectations and principles I follow. This page will include a picture of me and my family. It will also have some stock photos of leadership in the IT workplace. Furthermore, this part of my website will also include my education. Presently, that simply consists of high school and the semesters I’ve had here at BYU Idaho. I intend to expand this portion. With that said, it will be simple and self-explanatory.
